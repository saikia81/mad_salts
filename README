# A serious 2D sidescroller game
#
# Educational value may vary between:
# 1. The dangers, and basic properties of chemical combinations
# 2. salt memorising
#
# mode ideas
# learning mode: let's you play freely with the chemical components
# defender mode: is a castle defence game; the gameplay
# story mode: crazy scientist on the run against monsters with salts
#
# Game mechanics Ideas
# monster's attack each other when they are a different color (because elitism?)
# monster's chemical composition changes because of (a salt) reactions (and makes them susceptible to physical attacks)
